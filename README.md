New tools powered by artificial intelligence are changing the way we think about apps. And if you’re a developer looking to integrate your workflow, it’s time to supercharge your existing skills. In this course, instructor Denys Linkov offers an overview of how to build apps and integrate exciting, new open-source tools such as ChatGPT, Semantic Kernel, and LangChain.

Learn how to connect to the ChatGPT API to start building hands-on applications with code. Denys shows you the basics of app development with Semantic Kernel, from formatting to chain-of-thought reasoning, prompting, and OpenAI Whisper for text to speech. By the end of this course, you’ll also get a chance to try out your new skills building document search with LangChain and testing ChatGPT apps.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:
